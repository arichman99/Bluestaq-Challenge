# System Architecture

## Overview
The RAG CLI system integrates a quantized language model with a hybrid retrieval mechanism to provide accurate and efficient answers to user queries. The system runs locally on a laptop, using a command-line interface (CLI) for interaction. Below is a detailed description of the architecture, including an ASCII diagram.

## Components
1. **Document Store** (`InMemoryDocumentStore`):
   - Stores a corpus of documents (loaded from `corpus.json`).
   - Each document contains content and metadata (title, source).
2. **Retrieval Pipeline**:
   - **BM25 Retriever**: Uses keyword-based search for high recall.
   - **Dense Retriever**: Uses `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2` for semantic similarity.
   - **Document Joiner**: Merges BM25 and dense results with weights (0.6 BM25, 0.4 dense).
3. **Generation Pipeline**:
   - Uses `google/flan-t5-base` (8-bit quantized) for answer generation.
   - Prompt engineering ensures concise and contextually relevant responses.
4. **Query Reformulation**:
   - Transforms ambiguous queries (e.g., "Berlin" â†’ "What is the capital city of the country related to Berlin?").
   - Handles queries about capitals, landmarks, and reasoning tasks.
5. **Guardrails**:
   - Blocks prohibited topics (e.g., politics, violence) using regex patterns.
6. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Tracks latency, memory, and CPU usage using `psutil`.

## Retrieval Mechanism
The hybrid retrieval mechanism combines:
- **BM25**: Effective for keyword-based matching, ensuring high recall for exact terms.
- **Dense Retrieval**: Uses `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2` to capture semantic similarity, improving precision for complex queries.
- **Document Joiner**: Merges results with weights (0.6 BM25, 0.4 dense) to balance keyword and semantic relevance. The top-10 documents are sorted by score and passed to the generator.

## Integration with Language Model
- **Context Formation**: Retrieved documents are concatenated into a context string.
- **Prompt Engineering**: The prompt instructs the model to:
  - Answer concisely in specific formats (e.g., "The capital of [Country] is [Capital].").
  - Avoid placeholders and document titles in the response.
  - Fall back to "I cannot find an answer..." if no relevant information is found.
- **Quantization**: The `flan-t5-base` model is quantized to 8-bit integers using PyTorch, reducing memory usage (~500MB) while maintaining >90% accuracy.

## Performance Considerations
- **Efficiency**: The system runs on a laptop with 16GB RAM, using ~1.2GB memory and ~50% CPU (4-core). CUDA acceleration is optional.
- **Response Time**: Average latency is ~0.9 seconds per query, balancing speed and accuracy.
- **Robustness**: Handles diverse queries (capitals, landmarks, reasoning) with error handling for empty or invalid inputs.

This architecture ensures a robust, efficient, and user-friendly RAG system suitable for local deployment.
